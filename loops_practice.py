# loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code

# for loop is used to repeat something a fixed number of times

    # while loop runs as long as a condition is true
# Example 1
    x = 2                    # Begins with x = 2.
while x < 7:                    # Checks x < 7: if true, enters loop
    print(x)                    # Prints the current x, then increments.
    x += 1                      # Stops once x reaches 7

#Example 2

batch = 2               # batch starts at 2.
while batch <=6:        #Is batch <= 6? (2 <= 6) â†’ True, so enter loop.
  print("Python")       #Inside loop:  Prints "Python".
  batch += 1            # Executes batch += 1, so now batch becomes 3.
#   Once batch increments to 7, the condition (7 <= 6) is False, so the loop ends.

#  Nested loop is A loop inside another loop.
#Example 1

for i in range(2):       #0, 1
    for j in range(3):   # 0, 1, 2

#Example 2

#  Break and continue in Loops
# break is Used to stop the loop completely when a condition is met and loop stops
#Example 1 

for t in range(5):

        break
    print(t)

    print(item)

# Using continue
# continue is used to skip the current loop step and move to the next one

#Example 1

for i in range(1, 6):       # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    if i ==3:               # This loop will skip when i is 3
        continue
    print(i)

#Example 2

for item in items:
    if item == "sharperner":
        continue
